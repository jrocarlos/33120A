# 33120A
Procedure to automate Keysight/Agilent/HP 33120A signal generator calibration with Metcal software calibration.

To use this calibration software, Fluke Corpotarion's Metcal Calibration Software is required.

This allows calibration of frequency generation, power level generation, output voltage and reference frequency of the signal generator.

For communication between the software and the signal generator, a GPIB-USB converter cable is used.

The output data is saved in a microsoft excel spreadsheet.
